This project was written in the hours from 6pm to 4am, and had some
bugfixes from 4pm to 7pm on the following day. So don't expect something
extraordinarily cracy. If you want to know which features are supported,
checkout the testcases and see what is used there. The features supported
are enough to be turing complete, functions, branches, local variables,
simple arithmatic and basic list manipulation is supported.

The heard of the project is the pli.pl file.
It provides the eval function which is capable of executing
lisp written in Prolog style. Lisp written in prolog style looks
like the following:

(car (cdr (list 1 2 x)))
[car,[cdr,[list,1,2,x]]].

The pli script simply parses a lisp file and converts the 
lisp to Prolog style lisp. Since it is just a simple script,
badly placed spaces may lead to invalidly palced commans in the 
result, so take care. This script also does some magic output
generation but and makes sure that functions are available for
multiple expressions.

If you want to see some tests being executed run
./pli tests.lsp
